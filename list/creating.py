# Creating a List
# Here are some common methods to create a list:

# List of integers
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# List of strings
b = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Mixed data types
c = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# Using list() Constructor
# We can also create a list by passing an iterable (like a string, tuple, or another list) to list() function.

# From a tuple
r = list((1, 2, 3, 'apple', 4.5))  

print(r)
