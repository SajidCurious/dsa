# Iterating Over Lists
# We can iterate the Lists easily by using a for loop or other iteration methods. Iterating over lists is useful when we want to do some operation on each item or access specific items based on certain conditions. Letâ€™s take an example to iterate over the list using for loop.

a = ["Banana","Mango","Pineapple"]

for item in a:
    print(item)
