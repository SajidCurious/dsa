# Accessing List Elements
# Elements in a list can be accessed using indexing. Python indexes start at 0, so a[0] will access the first element, while negative indexing allows us to access elements from the end of the list. Like index -1 represents the last elements of list.

a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Access first element
print(a[0])

# Access second element
print(a[1]) 

# Access last element
print(a[-1])

# Access second element from the last
print(a[-2])
